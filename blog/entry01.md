##  Choosing my topic

The topic i chose for this project is cooking because i was always interested in this topic. I always wanted to know what technology we can make/ add to this topic.There were many other subject that i was also interested in like real estate/ business.Some websites that i found are https://cookingschoolguide.com/the-role-of-technology-in-modern-food-preparation/ and also these other websites https://newyorkculinaryschool.com/blog/culinary-news-trends/technology-shaping-modern-cooking.I was shocked by how impactful technology was on cooking.

## EDP
I'm currently on the step 1 of my EDP.Where we find a topic that we felt intersted in and spend a lot fo time researching that topic to learn about that topic.I want to inform the people around me about how how technology impacted culinary i feel like i will be on this stage for a long time because i will need to put a lot of research into this to support this.


## skills
Some of the skills i learned are time mangement and how to google 

### Time manangement 

I had a lot of time when outside of school. i used to do not a lot of work in the past but thru the years i had slowly started to improve my time management as in middle school i started going to afterschool programs for gardening and Also instead of wasting time playign video games now i started to help around in the house like cooking, doing other chores and etc


### how to google
I learned a more affective way to google as if u search up " cooking technology" a lot of results will pop up so you should just summarize what these website were trying to tell you about technology with cooking.
