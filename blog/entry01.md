##  Choosing my topic

The topic i chose for this project is cooking because I was always interested in this topic. I always wanted to know what technology we can add to this topic. There were many other subjects that i was also interested in like real estate/ business. Some websites I found are https://cookingschoolguide.com/the-role-of-technology-in-modern-food-preparation/ and https://newyorkculinaryschool.com/blog/culinary-news-trends/technology-shaping-modern-cooking. I was shocked by how impactful technology has been on cooking.

## EDP
I'm currently on step 1 of my EDP. Where we find a topic that we felt interested in and spend a lot fo time researching that topic to learn about that topic. I want to inform the people around me about how technology has impacted culinary arts. I feel like I will be on this stage for a long time because I will need to put a lot of research into this to support my claims.


## skills
Some of the skills I learned are time management and how to Google 

### Time management 

I had a lot of time outside of school. i used to not do a lot of work in the past, but through the years, I had slowly started to improve my time management. In middle school, I started going to after-school programs for gardening and Also, instead of wasting time playing video games, I started to help around in the house like cooking, doing other chores and etc.


### how to Google
I learned a more effective way to Google as if u search up " cooking technology," a lot of results will pop up, so you should just summarize what these websites were trying to tell you about technology with cooking.

## summary 
i cant wait to make a website on cooking as this feels like a dream becoming into reality.I hope the website would be very useful and creative
