##  Choosing my topic

The topic i chose for this project is cooking because i was always interested in this topic. I always wanted to know what technology we can make/ add to this topic.There were many other subject that i was also interested in like real estate/ business.Some websites that i found are https://cookingschoolguide.com/the-role-of-technology-in-modern-food-preparation/ and also these other websites https://newyorkculinaryschool.com/blog/culinary-news-trends/technology-shaping-modern-cooking.I was shocked by how impactful technology was on cooking.

## EDP
